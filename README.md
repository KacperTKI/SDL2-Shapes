# SDL2-Shapes

# What did I do?
I have created a SDL App, which shows shapes on the screen.

# What have I learned?
I have learned to use SDL. Also I learned to set up SDL with CMake. I followed a Course, which helped me structure the program. I continue this program and I will, in future, release a version, where there will be playable games with this code as its base.
